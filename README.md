## üîß Data Preparation in Alteryx

The Alteryx workflow overview:
1. Data Inputs
‚Ä¢ Industry master data: Contains the company‚Äôs sector and industry information.
‚Ä¢ Industry name-code mapping: Maps detailed industry names to industry codes.
‚Ä¢ Financial statement data: Holds company financials like Revenues, Profit, and Accounts Receivables.
‚Ä¢ Provisions and receivables aging data: Contains bad debt provisions and receivables aging breakdowns.
2. Data Preparation
‚Ä¢ Fixing industry codes: Recode specific industry names like ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarket research‚Äù
to standardized codes.
‚Ä¢ Updating marketing & leasing industries: Assign correct industry codes where needed.
‚Ä¢ Converting dates: Parse text date fields into Date format for financial reports and provisions.
‚Ä¢ Creating unique IDs: Combine company code and date into a single UID to enable proper joins
across datasets.
3. Joins
‚Ä¢ Merge industry datasets: Combine industry master data with name-code mappings.
‚Ä¢ Merge financial data with industry: Attach industry info to each company‚Äôs financial records.
‚Ä¢ Merge provisions data: Bring in receivables and bad debt provision data to the financial dataset.
4. Data Filtering & Type Corrections
‚Ä¢ Keep only records where:
‚Äì Financial year-end is Dec 31
‚Äì Revenue and Accounts Receivables are greater than 0.
‚Ä¢ Convert all numeric fields to the correct decimal data types for analysis.
5. Metrics Calculations
‚Ä¢ Prior Year AR: Pull prior year‚Äôs Accounts Receivables for each company.
‚Ä¢ Average AR: Compute as an average of current and prior year AR.
‚Ä¢ AR Turnover: Revenue √∑ Average AR.
‚Ä¢ Bad Receivables Ratio: Provisions √∑ AR.
‚Ä¢ Write-off Ratio: Write-offs √∑ AR.
6. Export
‚Ä¢ Select only the finalized columns needed for analysis.
‚Ä¢ Export the clean dataset as a CSV file ready for use in Python.
Outcome:
A clean, structured dataset containing key financials, industry info, and calculated receivables metrics across
31,433 of companies and multiple years, totaling to 227,000+ rows of data.

## üìä Python Analysis

The Python notebook (`Sales_Receivable_Mgt_Analysis.ipynb`) includes:
- Exploratory and diagnostic analysis to understand relationships between receivables and financial strength
- Cluster-level comparisons of receivables intensity across industries
- A basic **OLS Regression** model using `statsmodels` and `sklearn` to predict `Provision_Bad_Receivables`

### üîç Key Insights:
- Weak correlations between profitability/cash flow and bad receivables provisions
- Technology & Media industries exhibit higher receivables intensity, suggesting greater reliance on credit sales
- The OLS model demonstrates basic predictive capability with interpretability (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.14)
