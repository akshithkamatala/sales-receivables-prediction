# Sales Receivables Management Analysis

This project combines **Alteryx** and **Python** to analyze and predict financial risk using real-world financial data.

---

## üîß Data Preparation in Alteryx

The Alteryx workflow performs:
- Merging industry classification and name mappings
- Filtering financial records to include only those with meaningful Receivables and Revenues
- Computing custom metrics such as AR Turnover, Bad Receivables Ratio, and Write-off Ratio
- Exporting the final cleaned dataset to CSV for analysis in Python

## üìä Python Analysis

The Python notebook (`Sales_Receivable_Mgt_Analysis.ipynb`) includes:
- Exploratory and diagnostic analysis to understand relationships between receivables and financial strength
- Cluster-level comparisons of receivables intensity across industries
- A basic **OLS Regression** model using `statsmodels` and `sklearn` to predict `Provision_Bad_Receivables`

### üîç Key Insights:
- Weak correlations between profitability/cash flow and bad receivables provisions
- Technology & Media industries exhibit higher receivables intensity, suggesting greater reliance on credit sales
- The OLS model demonstrates basic predictive capability with interpretability (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.14)
