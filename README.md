# Sales Receivables Management Analysis

This project combines **Alteryx** and **Python** to analyze and predict financial risk using real-world financial data.

## Data Preparation in Alteryx

### The Alteryx workflow overview:

1. **Data Inputs**
   - Industry master data: Contains the company‚Äôs sector and industry information.
   - Industry name-code mapping: Maps detailed industry names to industry codes.
   - Financial statement data: Holds company financials like Revenues, Profit, and Accounts Receivables.
   - Provisions and receivables aging data: Contains bad debt provisions and receivables aging breakdowns.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Fixing industry codes: Recode specific industry names like ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarket research‚Äù to standardized codes.
   - Updating marketing & leasing industries: Assign correct industry codes where needed.
   - Converting dates: Parse text date fields into Date format for financial reports and provisions.
   - Creating unique IDs: Combine company code and date into a single UID to enable proper joins across datasets.

3. **Joins**
   - Merge industry datasets: Combine industry master data with name-code mappings.
   - Merge financial data with industry: Attach industry info to each company‚Äôs financial records.
   - Merge provisions data: Bring in receivables and bad debt provision data to the financial dataset.

4. **Data Filtering & Type Corrections**
   - Keep only records where:
     - Financial year-end is Dec 31
     - Revenue and Accounts Receivables are greater than 0.
   - Convert all numeric fields to the correct decimal data types for analysis.

5. **Metrics Calculations**
   - Prior Year AR: Pull prior year‚Äôs Accounts Receivables for each company.
   - Average AR: Compute as an average of current and prior year AR.
   - AR Turnover: Revenue √∑ Average AR.
   - Bad Receivables Ratio: Provisions √∑ AR.
   - Write-off Ratio: Write-offs √∑ AR.

6. **Export**
   - Select only the finalized columns needed for analysis.
   - Export the clean dataset as a CSV file ready for use in Python.

**Outcome:**  
A clean, structured dataset containing key financials, industry info, and calculated receivables metrics across 31,433 of companies and multiple years, totaling to 227,000+ rows of data.

## Python Analysis
###  Python Workflow Overview

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Loaded the cleaned CSV file exported from Alteryx
   - Filtered rows with valid values (non-null and greater than zero) for key variables

2. **Diagnostic Analysis**
   - Explored relationships between:
     - Profit/Cash Flow vs Bad Receivables Ratio
     - Receivables Intensity across industry clusters
   - Computed Pearson correlations (overall and per cluster)
   - Visualized insights using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`

3. **Regression Modeling**
   - Built an OLS Linear Regression model using `statsmodels` to predict `Provision_Bad_Receivables`
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
   - Evaluated model with:
     - R¬≤ Score
     - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - Compared actual vs predicted values with a scatter plot and regression line

4. **Interpretability Focus**
   - Used only intuitive financial predictors (e.g., Profit, AR, EBITDA) for transparency
   - Focused on a simple, explainable model instead of complex black-box algorithms
